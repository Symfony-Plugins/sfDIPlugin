sfDI plugin
===========

The `sfDIPlugin` is a symfony plugin that implements a stand-alone data
integration package. It can request heterogeneous data from several sources
and integrates it in a datagraph as SimpleXMLElement for further use by
application developers. It can be extended by new wrappers to handle more
data sources.

It already brings wrappers for Flickr and Photobucket.

Installation
------------

  * Download and install the plugin

        $ symfony plugin:install sfDIPlugin-<VERSION>.tgz

  * Call the data integrator from your application

        sfDI::getContent()

  * The method returns a datagraph as SimpleXMLElement

Extend plugin with new wrapper
------------------------------

  * A complete description about how to extend the plugin will be available on the upcoming project homepage.

TODO
----

  * Extend logging configuration (e.g. overwrite log file after 7 days, compress log file)
  * Write documentation and setup project homepage
